# Welcome to SIA's codebase and home. 
SIA is a data driven platform that recommends students on ideal career paths and graduate schools using information they wish to share.


## What we aim to do. 
SIA aims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to help recommend potentially ideal career paths for students based on the academic and professional experiences they wish to share, allowing students to explore a diverse range of fields and interests.


## Our motivation behind starting this project.
Contemporary culture tells us to reach certain milestones in order to be "successful" while these often drive us away from our true passion.
Our passion and determination to challenge the norms of “success” and help college students achieve their dreams differentiate us from the crowd. Backed by our team’s mix of disciplines, passions, and skill sets, we confidently believe that we can tackle this pertinent issue effectively.
